# description
the intention of this branch is to have something that gives additional control over the mindmap, with filters, toggles, multiple versions of a visualization, etc. 

# current status (may change daily)
on pause

## problems
- needs a massive refactor.
  + i was treating this branch as a hacky add-on, but that doesn't'work when the base code is hacky.

## to do
- i need to get to a point where i can go from a list or dictionary (which describes a graph and all its features) to a graph.
  + because when i have that, i can implement toggles and filters, which will be at their base, a `dict-->dict` (or list-->list), a function that transforms one graph representation (list or dict) into another
