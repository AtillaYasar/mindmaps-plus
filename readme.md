# description
the intention of this branch is to have something that gives additional control over the mindmap, with filters, toggles, multiple versions of a visualization, etc. 

# current status (may change daily)
working on a big refactor

## big refactor, learning experience
### things I'm doing for the first time
- abstract base classes
- inheritance and composition
- splitting python code over multiple files
- learning about design patterns and architecture (obviously not the first time I think about this stuff, but now I am explicitly learning about named concepts in this area)
