# how to run
- download ZIP
- unzip
- double click the file named app.py

or (if youre a NERD)
- git clone https://github.com/AtillaYasar/mindmaps-plus
- run app.py

## how to use
- there are 2 windows, one is the editor, one has the mindmap, and a secret notepad-like thingy if you press f1, f2 or f3
- this repository is not done, so both explanations and the program itself are lacking (BUT IT WORKS!)
- go to the the-tutorial node to get some more explanation (either click it in the list to the left in the editor window, or click it in the mindmap window, then itll be selected in the editor window)

- that is basically 1 big recording, but split into 6, because a free Bandicam account only lets you do 1 minute at a time
